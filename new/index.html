								<h3>Government offers paid incentives for pregnant women</h3>
								<p>
									The Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana project aims to improve maternal health and will offer cash incentives to pregnant women.
 

New Delhi: A project to improve the health and nutrition of pregnant, lactating women and infants will be implemented in 52 districts of the country at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on Wednesday approved the implementation of Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana (IGMSY), reports IANS.

Under the project, pregnant women and lactating mothers will be paid cash incentives for fulfillment of certain conditions related to mother and child nutrition, the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development said in a statement.

 As per the scheme, each pregnant and lactating woman in the target districts will receive a total cash incentive of Rs 4,000 in three installments between the periods from the second trimester of pregnancy to the child attaining the age of six months. All central and state government employees will be excluded from the scheme since they are entitled to paid maternity leave.

The project will be implemented in the Anganwadi centres. An estimated 13.8 lakh pregnant women will benefit from the scheme initially. "The objective of the scheme is to improve the health and nutrition status of pregnant, lactating women and infants by promoting appropriate practices during pregnancy, safe delivery and lactation," the statement said.</a>
